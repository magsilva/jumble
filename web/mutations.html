Jumble is capable of making a number of different of mutations:
</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Conditionals</b>: Jumble replaces each condition with its negation.
    Thus, for example, the condition <tt>x &gt; y</tt> would mutate to
    become <tt>!(x > y)</tt>. Such mutations are not limited to simple
    conditionals as in <tt>if</tt> statements. They also can occur in loop
    conditions of <tt>while</tt>, <tt>for</tt>, and <tt>do</tt> loops and
    in <tt>?:</tt> ternary operations. Conditionals include arithmetic
    comparisons, reference comparisons, and tests for null and
    not-null. The mutation is effected by means of the <tt>negate()</tt>
    method of <b>IfInstruction</b> class of BCEL.  Note that in a complex
    decision that contains several conditions, each condition will be
    mutated separately.<p>

    The modification of a conditional can cause infinite looping. Jumble
    detects this situation by first timing the test on the unmodified code,
    then if the mutated code takes more than a certain multiple of this
    time the test is assumed to have caused infinite looping and the result
    is deemed to be a pass. Such results are indicated by a <tt>T</tt> in
    the test output.<p>

    Jumble always mutates conditionals.<p>
</li>

<li><b>Binary Arithmetic Operations</b>: Jumble can replace binary
    arithmetic operations for either integer or floating-point arithmetic
    with another operation. The replacement operation is selected according
    to the table below. Fixed replacements rather than random replacements
    are used because sometimes different operations will (correctly)
    produce the same result. Even when using the fixed replacements of the
    table such a situation can occasionally arise.<p>

    <p>
    Jumble always mutates binary arithmetic operations.<p>
</li>

<li><b>Increments</b>: Increments, decrements, and the assignment
    increments and decrements are mutated to their opposite sign.  For
    example, <tt>i++</tt> becomes <tt>i--</tt>.<p>

    This mutation is off by default, but can be turned on using
    the "-i" or "--increments" command-line flags.<p>
</li>

<li><b>Inline Constants</b>: Jumble can change the value of literal constants
    used in <b>const</b> instructions and various <b>push</b>
    instructions. Because Jumble cannot tell from the class file whether
    such constants are ints, shorts, characters, bytes, or booleans, some
    confusion can occur when interpreting the output of these mutations. If
    the mutated value happens to corresponding to a printable ASCII
    character then this value appears in parenthesis after the numerical
    value. A value of 0 might also be a boolean false and a value of 1 a
    boolean true.<p>

    The mutation of inline constants is off by default, but can be turned
    on using the "-k" or "--inline-consts" command-line flags.<p>
</li>


<li><b>Class Pool Constants</b>: Jumble can change the value of
    literal constants and strings that appear in the "class pool"
    of a class.  Primitive literals (ints, doubles etc.) are mutated
    in a similar way to inline constants, and string literals are replaced
    by the string "__jumble__" or "___jumble___".<p>

    The mutation of constant pool entries is off by default, but can be
    turned on using the "-w" or "--cpool" command-line flags.<p>
</li>

<li><b>Return Values</b>: Jumble can change return values. For primitive
    booleans, shorts, characters, integers, floats, and doubles non-zero
    returns can be changed to 0 and 0 returns are changed to 1. For objects
    non-null returns can be changed to null; for null returns a
    RuntimeException is invoked (this is because Jumble cannot reliably
    instantiate a valid object or arbitrary type).<p>

    This mutation is off by default, but can be turned on using
    the "-r" or "--return-vals" command-line flags.<p>
</li>

<li><b>Switch Statements</b>: Jumble can mutate each case of a
    switch statement by swapping it with the default case or another
    case, or by changing the case value.<p>
    
    This mutation is off by default, but can be turned on using
    the "-j" or "--switch" command-line flags.<p>
</li>
</ul>
