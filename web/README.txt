This directory contains the source for the Jumble web site:

   http://jumble.sourceforge.net

See index.html for the main page.
This is the main source of Jumble documentation at the moment.

The UpdateWeb.sh script will copy the updated files onto that site.
Usage:  UpdateWeb.sh sourceforge_username


This directory also contains scripts for running Jumble within
the Apache web server.  Not well-documented yet...
See jumble.cgi (especially the "Editable variables" section)
and apache.conf.d_jumble.
